This mobile app is designed to tackle food waste by connecting local donors with those in need. Users can share surplus food with neighbours, reducing waste and promoting a sustainable, community-driven solution. Developed as part of my Final Year Project, this platform aims to benefit both the local community and the environment by making food-sharing easy and accessible.
